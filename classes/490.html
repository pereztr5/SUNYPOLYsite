                In out initial lessons of Linux Networking we learned how to work with the command line and
how to get help when we did not know what a command meant. We also learned to use VIM because that
is how we will be editing files on our CentOS box. This lab was to initially get us started with our CentOS
Minimal VM. We walk through step on how to set up basic networking, partition resizing, and managing
user and groups.

                In this lab we learned more command-line tools to manage and manipulate files. We also
learned how to use certain programs and commands that helped us get information and
change how they are displayed. Many of the programs and commands we learned have been
useful and seem to be very common. They make certain tasks easier when configuring your
Linux box. In general we learned that there are many commands that can help us do tasks
easier and in the way we want it. In the end we were assigned a task to produce a custom
banner with some information about our machine and environment that must be displayed
every time the user logged in.

We used the program called the crontab to schedule these scripts at certain times. We have
already dealt with scripting in our previous lab to run certain commands on start-up. That
bash script we edited was called the bashrc file which was executed every time we logged
on.

I will be setting up a local DNS server to use internally. The purpose of this is to build a DNS
server that will be used to reach domains within the local network for testing purposes or just
internal use. For example if you set up a web server or media server to use internally instead of
using the IP address you can just assign a domain of your choice which will ale it much easier to
use. The DNS server will also be able to reach other DNS servers like Google's if they still want
to reach a domain outside of the LAN. I will be using BIND for my DNS server. BIND is an implementation
of the Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. We will create test servers like a
nginx web server and a media server like Plex and give them a domain name to be used on our
LAN. For security features I will be implementing DNSSEC, which stands for DNS Security Extension.
DNSSEC makes sure that the DNS record is authentic and helps fight DNS spoofing or
also known as DNS Poisoning. DNS Poisoning is when someone would replace the original IP
address of the domain name with a different one which would cause you to go to the wrong cite.

                For this this lab we learned how to compile software from source code and saw how the kernel was
setup and built. Both tasks were more tedious then a simple install of a software or just installing the
default kernel. Both compiling from source and building a kernel will help to target the specific CPU
and hardware specs and so it would run smoother and also be more light weight since we would only be
installing what we want. Although it is not necessary to do this all the time it is a good practice for
when we need to built the best system for a specific task and would want it to run well.

                In this lab we learned and implemented how to secure our Linux machines. Security is important
especially in today's world where break ins are common. Securing our systems require more of a setup but
it will prevent unwanted visitors. It might not seem important and tedious until someone breaks in and
steals or destroys our data. One of the most common ways is to implement and enforce better password
policies. Other security measures are to not run things we do not need and to have an anti-virus. There
are also network security measures we can implement to improve our system's security.

                For this lab we learned how to setup a DNS server. We had two DNS servers a master and a slave
for redundancy. Although for our purpose we did not need two DNS servers it is a good practice to
usually have two setup up for load balancing, as a backup, and in some cases for better routing. Domain
Name Service (DNS) is used to translate an IP address to a host name or a host name to an IP address.
Although our ISP or Google have a DNS server in which we could use we wanted a local DNS so we
could use domain names instead of IP address on our LAN. There are other benefits to having your own
DNS like caching and blocking unwanted websites or certain IP addresses.

                For this lab we installed a FTP server on one machine and then used our other machine as a client to test

module in our iptables-config file.

was all done to setup a secure web server so we could see how it worked. We used our very own ssl,
Secure Socket Layer, certifications to test and see if our site worked over HTTPS.

Instead I showed other domains that were on a DNS server with DNSSEC implemented.
